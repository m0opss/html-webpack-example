A simple example of using Webpack with BEM. Any `bemjson` and `bemdecl` files are not used.

All technologies is added to bundle based only on HTML code. You only need to `require` your HTML code somewhere:

```javascript
require('./index.html');
```
This is a just example of how `html2bemdecl-loader` and `bemdecl-to-fs-loader` may be used. There is many other ways to build your project with it.
